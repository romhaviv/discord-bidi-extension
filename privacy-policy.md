# Privacy Policy for Discord Bidi Fix

Effective Date: 17-May-2025

Thank you for using the Discord Bidi Fix Chrome extension.

## What This Extension Does

This extension applies a small CSS fix (`unicode-bidi: plaintext`) to all `<span>` elements on the Discord web app (https://discord.com). This improves the display of mixed right-to-left (RTL) and left-to-right (LTR) text, such as Hebrew or Arabic combined with English.

## Data Collection

This extension **does not collect, store, or transmit** any personal information or user data.

- No user activity is tracked.
- No external servers are contacted.
- No analytics are used.

## Permissions

The extension only requests access to `https://discord.com/*` in order to apply the CSS styling needed to fix text direction. It does not modify any other part of the website or access any private information.

## Contact

If you have questions or concerns about this policy, please contact the developer via Discord:  
[https://discord.com/channels/1373268242608558133/1373269132300128367](https://discord.com/channels/1373268242608558133/1373269132300128367)

This privacy policy may be updated in the future if the functionality of the extension changes.
